# In this exercise you will use the same dictionaries as the ones we used in the lesson - prices and quantity. This time, don't just calculate all the money Jan spent. Calculate how much she spent on products with a price of 5 dollars or more.

prices = {
    "box_of_spaghetti": 4,
    "lasagna": 5,
    "hamburger": 2
   }
   
quantity = {
    "box_of_spaghetti": 6,
    "lasagna": 10,
    "hamburger": 0
    }

money_spent = 0

for i in prices:
    if prices[i] >= 5:
        money_spent += quantity[i] * prices[i]
print(money_spent)
        

# How much did Jan spent on products that cost less than 5 dollars?
